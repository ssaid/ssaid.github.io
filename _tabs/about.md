Hi, I'm a backend developer with experience in Odoo, an open-source ERP and business management software. I have been working with Odoo for several years now and have gained a lot of experience in developing custom modules and integrating Odoo with other systems.

Recently, I have developed a keen interest in DevOps and am pursuing a career in this field. I believe that automation, continuous integration, and deployment are critical aspects of modern software development, and I'm eager to learn more about DevOps practices and tools.

As a backend developer, I have a strong foundation in software development. I am familiar with programming languages like Python, version control, and software architecture, which are all essential skills for DevOps engineers.

With my background in backend development and experience with Odoo, I have a unique perspective on software development. I believe that my skills and knowledge can be valuable in the world of DevOps. I'm excited about the opportunities that DevOps offers and am committed to growing my skills and knowledge in this field.

On my personal blog, I'll be sharing my experiences and insights on backend development, Odoo, and DevOps. I hope to connect with others who share my passion for these topics and learn from their experiences as well.
