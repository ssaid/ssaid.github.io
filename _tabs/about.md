Hi, I'm a backend python developer with +10 Years of experience in Odoo, an open-source ERP and business management software.

Recently, I have developed a keen interest in DevOps. I believe that automation, continuous integration, and deployment are critical aspects of modern software development, and I'm eager to learn more about DevOps practices and tools.

On my personal blog, I'll be sharing my experiences and insights on development and DevOps. I hope to connect with others who share my passion for these topics and learn from their experiences as well.
